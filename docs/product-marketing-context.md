| Persona | Role | Cares about | Challenge | Value we promise |

## Problems & Pain Points

**Core problem:**
Collectors and sellers are stuck between two bad options: auction houses that take 20-30% commissions and move slowly, or mass marketplaces flooded with fakes, lowballers, and tire-kickers.

**Why alternatives fall short:**
- **eBay/Etsy:** Overwhelming noise, fake items, no curation, race-to-the-bottom pricing
- **Traditional auction houses:** 6-month waitlists, 25-30% fees, intimidating for new sellers
- **Facebook/Craigslist:** No verification, no protection, local-only limitations
- **Dealer networks:** Exclusive by design, hard to break into, information asymmetry

**What it costs them:**
- **Time:** Hours filtering through junk listings or waiting for auction slots
- **Money:** $5,000-15,000 in fees on a $50,000 sale
- **Opportunity:** Rare items sell for 40% less on mass marketplaces due to lack of serious buyers
- **Trust:** Anxiety about authenticity, payment disputes, shipping damage

**Emotional tension:**
- "Am I getting ripped off?" (buyers)
- "Is this worth what they're asking?" (sellers)
- "I know this is valuable but I don't know how to prove it" (estate sellers)
- "I missed out on that item because I didn't see it in time" (collectors)

## Competitive Landscape

**Direct competitors:**
- **Heritage Auctions** — falls short because 25% fees, 3-6 month timelines, no seller control
- **LiveAuctioneers** — falls short because clunky UX, no community features, limited discovery
- **Invaluable** — falls short because auction-house focus, not built for individual sellers

**Secondary competitors:**
- **eBay** — falls short because fake items, no curation, overwhelming volume
- **Etsy** — falls short because handmade focus, not built for high-value collectibles
- **Instagram/Depop** — falls short because no bidding system, no buyer protection

**Indirect competitors:**
- **Facebook Groups** — falls short because no structure, no verification, payment risks
- **Local dealer networks** — falls short because exclusive, opaque pricing, hard to access
- **Storage/consignment** — falls short because no liquidity, items sit for months/years

---

## Differentiation

**Key differentiators:**
1. **Curated listings only** — no random junk, everything is reviewed
2. **7-day sale cycles** — fast liquidity without auction house delays
3. **3% flat fee** — transparent pricing, no hidden costs
4. **Verified profiles** — both buyers and sellers are ID-verified
5. **Escrow protection** — funds held until item is received and authenticated

**How we do it differently:**
Instead of being a marketplace for everyone, we're a marketplace for serious collectors. Every collection is vetted by our team. Every user verifies their identity. The bidding process is transparent—no reserve price games, no shill bidding.

**Why that's better:**
- Sellers get fair market value faster
- Buyers trust what they're buying
- The community polices itself—bad actors are removed
- Transactions happen in days, not months

**Why customers choose us:**
"I sold my watch collection on eBay and dealt with 47 lowball offers and 3 returns. On Luxor, I had 12 serious bids and sold everything in 5 days." — Marcus T., Estate Curator

## Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "How do I know items are authentic?" | Every seller is ID-verified and rated. High-value items include authentication documentation. Buyers can request independent authentication before release of funds. |
| "What if the item isn't as described?" | Funds are held in escrow until you confirm receipt. If there's a dispute, our resolution team steps in with photo evidence requirements. |
| "3% is still a fee—why not sell privately?" | Private sales take 3-6 months to find a buyer. You'll spend more on storage, insurance, and time than the 3% fee. Plus, you get access to buyers you couldn't reach on your own. |
| "I've never heard of Luxor Bids" | We're newer than the auction houses, but our community is growing 40% month-over-month. Every serious collector in our beta said they'd never go back to traditional auctions. |
| "What if no one bids on my items?" | Our curators work with you before listing to set realistic reserves and timing. If an item doesn't sell, you pay nothing and we give you feedback on why. |

**Anti-persona:**
Casual sellers looking to flip thrift store finds. Bargain hunters expecting 50% discounts. Anyone who sees collectibles as "just stuff" rather than passion investments.

## Switching Dynamics

**Push (what drives them away from current solutions):**
- "I'm tired of auction houses taking 30% and making me wait 6 months"
- "eBay is 90% junk now—I'm wasting hours filtering"
- "I got scammed on Facebook Marketplace last month"
- "My dealer takes 50% and I have no control over pricing"

**Pull (what attracts them to us):**
- "Finally, a platform that understands high-end collectibles"
- "3% fee vs. 30% at Christie's—that's $12,000 more in my pocket"
- "The interface feels like what I've come to expect from modern apps"
- "Every bidder is verified—I don't worry about fake accounts"

**Habit (what keeps them stuck):**
- "I've sold on eBay for 15 years—I know the system"
- "My dealer has been good to me, even if the fees are high"
- "Auction houses are what serious collectors use... right?"
- "Learning a new platform feels like a hassle"

**Anxiety (what worries them about switching):**
- "What if I don't get any bids?"
- "Is this site legit? I've never heard of it"
- "What happens if there's a dispute?"
- "Will the buyers here actually pay premium prices?"

|------|---------|
| **Collection** | A curated group of items from one seller, released together |
| **Floor Price** | The minimum bid currently accepted (like "starting at") |

## Design Direction

**Visual style:**
Dark, premium aesthetic. NFT marketplace vibes but for physical collectibles. Think: Blur.io meets Christie's.

**Color palette:**
- Background: Deep charcoal/black (#0a0a0a)
- Cards: Slightly lighter (#111, #1a1a1a)
- Accent: Warm amber/orange (#f59e0b) — evokes gold, value, rarity
- Success: Green (#10b981)
- Error: Red (#ef4444)
- Text: White and grays (#fff, #9ca3af)

**Typography:**
- Headlines: Bold, uppercase for numbers and labels
- Body: Clean sans-serif, excellent readability
- Monospace for prices and stats (gives data credibility)

**UI patterns:**
- Glassmorphism cards with subtle borders
- High-quality collection imagery (hero sections)
- Data-dense tables (like Bloomberg terminal for collectibles)
- Real-time bid indicators (pulsing animations)
- Clear visual hierarchy: Price > Status > Bids > Details

**Mood:**
Exclusive. Premium. Serious. This isn't a garage sale—it's a trading floor for the discerning collector.
