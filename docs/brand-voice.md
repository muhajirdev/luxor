# Brand Voice & Verbal Identity

*Last updated: February 12, 2026*

---

## Voice vs. Tone

**Voice** is our personality—consistent across every touchpoint.  
**Tone** adapts to context while staying true to our voice.

> Think of it this way: You have the same voice whether talking to your boss or your best friend—but your tone changes.

---

## Voice Attributes

### 1. Knowledgeable—but not gatekeepy

We know the collectibles world intimately. We speak the language. But we never make others feel small for not knowing.

**This:** "Patina refers to the surface aging that authenticates vintage pieces."  
**Not that:** "Only true collectors understand the value of proper patina."

**Do:** Share expertise generously. Explain terms when needed. Assume intelligence.  
**Don't:** Use jargon to exclude. Talk down. Assume everyone knows niche terminology.

---

### 2. Confident—but not cocky

We know we're building something better than traditional auction houses. But we let the product speak for itself.

**This:** "3% fee. No hidden costs. No surprises."  
**Not that:** "We're the best platform ever created for collectibles."

**Do:** State facts plainly. Let data and results build credibility.  
**Don't:** Overpromise. Use hyperbole. Make claims we can't back up.

---

### 3. Exclusive—but not snobby

We're curated by design. Not everyone gets in. But that selectivity serves our community, not our ego.

**This:** "Every collection is reviewed before listing. This keeps quality high."  
**Not that:** "Only elite sellers are welcome here."

**Do:** Celebrate curation as quality control. Welcome serious collectors warmly.  
**Don't:** Act superior. Create artificial scarcity. Make people feel unworthy.

---

### 4. Modern—but not trendy

We bring Silicon Valley UX to a dusty industry. But we're not chasing every design fad.

**This:** "The interface you expect from modern apps, applied to serious collecting."  
**Not that:** "We're disrupting the antiquated auction industry with blockchain AI synergy."

**Do:** Highlight improvements over legacy systems. Show, don't tell.  
**Don't:** Use buzzwords. Promise "revolutionary" changes. Sound like a startup pitch deck.

---

### 5. Transparent—but not blunt

We hide nothing: fees, processes, policies. But we communicate with care, not coldness.

**This:** "If your item doesn't sell, you pay nothing. Here's why that might happen..."  
**Not that:** "Most items sell. Some don't. That's business."

**Do:** Explain the "why" behind policies. Admit limitations openly.  
**Don't:** Hide bad news in fine print. Be robotic. Avoid difficult conversations.

## Tone Adaptation Matrix

### By Channel

| Channel | Tone Adjustment | Example |
|---------|-----------------|---------|
| **Homepage/Marketing** | Confident, benefit-focused | "Keep 97% of every sale. Sell in 7 days." |
| **Product UI** | Concise, action-oriented | "Place bid" not "Submit your bidding offer" |
| **Email (sellers)** | Direct, results-focused | "Your collection has 12 active bidders" |
| **Email (buyers)** | Enthusiastic, discovery-focused | "A collection matching your interests just dropped" |
| **Customer Support** | Empathetic, solution-focused | "I understand the urgency—let's resolve this now" |
| **Error Messages** | Helpful, human | "We couldn't process that bid. Try again or contact support." |
| **Legal/Compliance** | Clear, precise | "Per our Seller Agreement, section 4.2..." |
| **Social Media** | Conversational, engaging | "That 1959 Les Paul just sold for $47K in 4 days" |

### By User Emotional State

| User State | Tone Response |
|------------|---------------|
| **Excited (won an item)** | Match their energy. Celebrate the acquisition. |
| **Anxious (first-time seller)** | Reassuring, concrete, specific steps. |
| **Frustrated (dispute)** | Empathy first. Then solution. "I understand this is frustrating..." |
| **Confused (how bidding works)** | Patient, clear, step-by-step. No judgment. |
| **Confident (experienced user)** | Efficient, direct. Don't slow them down. |

## Nielsen Norman Group Dimensions

Where we sit on the four dimensions of tone:

| Dimension | Our Position | Rationale |

| **Humor** | 20% funny, 80% serious | Occasional wit in marketing, never in product UI or support |
| **Reverence** | 40% irreverent, 60% respectful | Challenge legacy auction house norms, but respect the collecting tradition |
| **Energy** | 60% enthusiastic, 40% matter-of-fact | Excited about great finds, measured about processes |

## Messaging Architecture

### Purpose
Luxor Bids connects serious collectors with verified sellers through a transparent, efficient bidding platform.

### Value Proposition
**For Sellers:** Sell your collection in 7 days, keep 97% of the price.  
**For Buyers:** Discover verified rare items from vetted sellers. Bid with confidence.

### Elevator Pitch
"Traditional auction houses take 25-30% and make you wait months. Mass marketplaces are flooded with fakes. Luxor Bids is the curated middle ground: verified sellers, serious buyers, 3% fees, 7-day sales."

### Key Messages

| Message | Supporting Proof |
|---------|------------------|
| **Verified means trustworthy** | Every seller ID-verified. Every collection reviewed. 0% fraud rate. |
| **Fast doesn't mean rushed** | 7-day cycles create urgency. Escrow protects both parties. |
| **Curated means quality** | 94% of collections receive bids within 48 hours. Average sale: $4,200. |
| **Transparent means fair** | 3% fee. No hidden costs. No reserve games. |

Exception: Legal text, error messages, and formal notifications use full forms.

### Punctuation
- **Periods:** Use for complete thoughts. Even in UI microcopy.
- **Oxford comma:** Yes. "Verified, curated, and ready to bid."
- **Exclamation points:** Sparingly. Only for genuine excitement (win notifications, milestones).

### Capitalization

## Channel-Specific Guidelines

2. **Action-oriented.** Verbs before nouns.

- ✅ "Ends in 2 days" (not "This auction will close in 48 hours")
- ✅ "Verify your ID to bid" (not "Please complete the identity verification process")

### Email Copy

**Subject Lines:**
- Under 50 characters when possible
- Front-load value: "Your collection sold" not "Update on your listing"
- Avoid spam triggers: "FREE!" "URGENT!" "ACT NOW!"

**Body:**
- Lead with the most important information
- One primary CTA per email
- Sign with a name (from the team)

### Support Copy

**Opening:** Acknowledge the issue specifically.  
**Middle:** Explain clearly, offer solutions.  
**Closing:** Confirm resolution, offer further help.

**Template:**
